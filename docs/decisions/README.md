# Decision records

One file per decision, numbered, never edited after acceptance. A reversal is a new record that supersedes the old one.

| Number | Title | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | Clean Architecture as a bun monorepo | accepted |
| 0002 | Postgres through Drizzle, not supabase-js | accepted |
| 0003 | External API with Hono inside Next.js | accepted |
| 0004 | Billing cycles are ours, not the provider's | accepted |
| 0005 | No comments in code | accepted |
| 0006 | Multi-tenant from the first entity | accepted |
| 0007 | Row level security keyed on a transaction local setting | accepted |
| 0008 | Identity resolution and api keys | accepted |
| 0009 | OpenAPI generated from zod and documentation rendered on the server | accepted |
| 0010 | Idempotency and rate limit stores start in memory | accepted |
| 0011 | Provider failures are unavailable domain errors | accepted |
| 0012 | Configuration is validated at runtime, not at build | accepted |
| 0013 | The remote address trusts the platform header first | accepted |
| 0014 | The development actor requires its own flag, not just NODE_ENV | accepted |
| 0015 | A deferred job queue is its own table, not pgmq | accepted |
| 0016 | A document is uploaded directly to storage, never through the API body | accepted |
| 0017 | Consent categories exclude what is strictly necessary, and coverage is checked against the policy version | accepted |
| 0018 | The right to erasure anonymizes in place; it never deletes a row | superseded by 0033 |
| 0019 | Field-level encryption keys are rotated by keeping old ones, not by re-encrypting | accepted |
| 0020 | Telemetry traces one span per HTTP request and one per job execution, never per database query | accepted |
| 0021 | The audit trail is a cross-cutting application port, append only at the database level, and it survives anonymization | accepted |
| 0022 | Analytics loads under the existing strict-dynamic policy, and server events never let the browser talk to the provider | accepted |
| 0023 | Module activation is a static file next to the layer graph, never a runtime flag checked with if | accepted |
| 0024 | Field encryption keys become mandatory the moment real persistence is configured, independent of any module | accepted |
| 0025 | A variable that belongs to no module is still required in production if its absence is unsafe, and a gate now proves nothing else falls through | accepted |
| 0026 | An active optional module requires its real provider in production, with no middle state, and architecture/ is now a layer nothing but src/main may read | accepted |
| 0027 | Component source is copied by hand from official documentation, never through an unpinned CLI | accepted |
| 0028 | Three dispatch triggers, and fair multi-tenant job scheduling | accepted |
| 0029 | The GitHub Actions dispatch trigger is opt-in per repository, and off in this base | accepted |
| 0030 | Money is an integer count of minor units, and a provider notification is verified inside the adapter | accepted |
| 0031 | The stop hook runs `check:fast`, the full check runs once at pre-push and CI | accepted |
| 0032 | Code scanning stays as it is, and a private derivative either buys it or turns it off | accepted |
| 0033 | The anonymization token is random, superseding the deterministic one in 0018 | accepted |
| 0034 | The privacy source ports take their tenant per call, and that is the exception to the tenant scoped rule | accepted |
