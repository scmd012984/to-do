# Agent guide

This repository is a base. Projects derive from it. It follows Clean Architecture (Martin) and enforces it with tooling. Read this file first; it is the map. Follow links only when your task needs them.

## Hard rules

1. Dependencies point inward. `architecture/layers.json` is the graph. Nothing else defines it.
2. No comments in any file, of any syntax. Names carry meaning.
3. No `any`. No `process.env` outside `apps/*/src/main`.
4. bun only. Never npm, pnpm, yarn or npx.
5. Never push, deploy, force, reset hard or bypass hooks unless the user asked in their own words.
6. Never weaken a gate to make something pass. Propose a decision record instead.
7. Conventional commits. No AI attribution in commits.
8. Every port ships with interface, contract suite, memory implementation, real implementation and wiring.
9. Every aggregate is tenant scoped. Every use case authorizes before acting.
10. Views decide nothing; presenters decide everything visible; use cases decide everything else.
11. Adding or removing a directory updates `ESTRUCTURA.md` in the same change. `bun run structure` enforces it.
12. A variable added to `moduleEnvVariables` in any `apps/*/src/main/env.ts` is added to `.env.example` in the same change. `bun run env-example` enforces it.
13. Work closes only after `layer-guardian` and `security-reviewer` have read its diff in a fresh context. Whoever wrote the code never reviews it. Every commit states this in its message, either `Reviewed-by: layer-guardian, security-reviewer` or `Review-exempt: <why>`; the `commit-msg` hook rejects a commit with neither. The trailer records that the step happened, it does not judge the review itself.
14. Which business modules exist and which are active lives in `architecture/modules.json`, read through `architecture/modules.ts`. Nothing else decides it, and no `if (isModuleActive(...))` is scattered through a use case, a handler or an executor: a module that is off is simply never mounted at the composition root.
15. A defect found in review does not close until `docs/defects/` records it, naming a gate, a test, or the reason neither exists yet. `bun run defects` enforces it.

## Workflow

Design before code for anything beyond a one ring change. Inner rings first. Tests before moving outward. `bun run check` green before reporting. Report what was left undone and why.
